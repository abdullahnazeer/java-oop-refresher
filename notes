Object - contains data in the form of properties and methods
       - instance of a class

Four pillars of OOP:

Abstraction -

Only showing what is necessary to the user of an object.
Hiding implementation details inside something.

Inheritance -

Encourages code re-usability by letting one object acquire the properties of another object.

super class / base class / parent class <--- sub class / extended class / child class

NO MULTIPLE INHERITANCE IN JAVA

Inheritance has an "IS A" relationship
sub class IS A super class
Ford Focus IS A Car

Polymorphism -

Poly = many, Morph = forms

The ability of a class to run a method in two or more different ways.

Encapsulation -

Built on the idea of data hiding.
Data hiding - where we restrict access to certain properties or methods of an object to whatever is calling the object

Encapsulate a class using private properties - with public getter and setter methods
